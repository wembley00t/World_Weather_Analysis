# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to use APIs to create an app to retrieve weather data and a customer travel destinations map
and travel iternary map.

Users will input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the user will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

The deliverables for this project are:

** Retrieve Weather Data
** Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
** Create a Travel Itinerary Map
